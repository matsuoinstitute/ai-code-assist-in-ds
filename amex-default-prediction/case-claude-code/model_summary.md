# Credit Default Prediction Model Summary

## Overview
Built an industrial-scale machine learning model to predict credit defaults using a large dataset with time-series customer behavior data and anonymized customer profiles.

## Dataset Characteristics
- **Training Data**: 15GB (5.5M+ rows, 190 features)
- **Test Data**: 32GB (11M+ rows, 190 features)  
- **Customers**: 458,913 unique customers with labels
- **Features**: 190 mixed-type features (Balance, Spend, Payment, Delinquency, Risk)

## Feature Engineering
### Statistical Aggregations
- **Balance Features (B_)**: mean, std, min, max, last values per customer
- **Spend Features (S_)**: mean, std, sum, max aggregations
- **Payment Features (P_)**: mean, std, max aggregations
- **Risk & Delinquency (R_, D_)**: mean, max, sum aggregations

### Advanced Engineered Features
1. **Credit Utilization**: B_1 / (B_2 + Îµ) ratio
2. **Balance Volatility**: Average standard deviation across balance features
3. **Risk Concentration**: Sum of all risk features per customer
4. **Time-based Features**: From S_2 timestamp data

### Final Feature Set
- **933 features** created from original 190 features
- Customer-level aggregations from time-series data
- Focus on numeric features for computational efficiency

## Model Architecture

### Primary Model: LightGBM
```python
Hyperparameters:
- objective: binary classification
- num_leaves: 100
- learning_rate: 0.05
- max_depth: 10
- feature_fraction: 0.8
- bagging_fraction: 0.8
- reg_alpha: 0.1, reg_lambda: 0.1
- n_estimators: 1000 (with early stopping)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Validation AUC**: 0.9554
- **Early Stopping**: Iteration 322 (out of 1000)
- **Feature Importance**: D_39_last, P_2_last, B_4_last most important

## Top 10 Most Important Features
1. **D_39_last** (Delinquency - most recent value)
2. **P_2_last** (Payment - most recent value)  
3. **B_4_last** (Balance - most recent value)
4. **B_3_last** (Balance - most recent value)
5. **B_5_last** (Balance - most recent value)
6. **B_4_std** (Balance volatility)
7. **S_3_last** (Spend - most recent value)
8. **R_1_last** (Risk - most recent value)
9. **R_3_last** (Risk - most recent value)
10. **D_41_last** (Delinquency - most recent value)

## Technical Optimizations

### Memory Management
- **Chunked Processing**: 50K row chunks to handle 15GB+ datasets
- **Customer Sampling**: 100K customers for training efficiency
- **Garbage Collection**: Aggressive memory cleanup between stages
- **Data Types**: Focus on numeric features, skip string processing

### Computational Efficiency  
- **Polars/Pandas**: Efficient data loading and processing
- **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting and reduce training time
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threading with n_jobs=-1
- **Feature Selection**: Automated removal of non-predictive features

## Submission Results
- **File**: submission.csv
- **Shape**: 924,621 predictions
- **Prediction Range**: [0.000071, 0.999680]
- **Mean Prediction**: 0.2428 (matches expected default rate)
- **Distribution**: Realistic probability distribution

## Model Insights

### Key Findings
1. **Recency Matters**: Most recent values (_last features) are most predictive
2. **Balance Volatility**: Standard deviation of balances is highly predictive
3. **Delinquency History**: Past delinquency patterns strongly predict defaults
4. **Payment Behavior**: Recent payment patterns are crucial indicators

### Business Interpretation
- Model focuses on **recent behavior** over historical patterns
- **Balance management** and **payment consistency** are key risk factors
- **Risk concentrations** across multiple dimensions matter
- Time-series nature of data is successfully captured through aggregations

## Competition Strategy

### Strengths
- Handles massive datasets efficiently
- Comprehensive feature engineering
- Strong validation performance (AUC 0.9554)
- Focuses on most predictive patterns

### Potential Improvements
1. **Full Dataset**: Process all customers (not sampled subset)
2. **Ensemble Methods**: XGBoost + CatBoost + LightGBM ensemble
3. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning for complex interactions
4. **Time-Series Modeling**: LSTM or time-aware architectures
5. **Advanced Features**: Interaction terms, polynomial features

## Reproducibility
All code is modular and documented:
- `final_credit_model.py`: Main training pipeline
- `kaggle_submit.py`: Automated Kaggle submission
- `requirements.txt`: Package dependencies
- Full preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline included

## Expected Competition Performance
Based on validation AUC of 0.9554, this model should achieve competitive performance on the private leaderboard of the American Express Default Prediction competition.
